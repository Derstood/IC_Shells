example:
	csh waitOneFile "x" 		to wait x
	csh waitOneFile "x1"		to wait x1
	csh waitOneFile "x2"		to wait x2
	csh waitFiles.csh "x2"		to wait x2
	csh waitFiles.csh "x x1 x2" to wait x1 x2 x3
	csh waitFiles.csh "x x2"	to wait x x2
	csh waitFiles.csh "x*"		to wait x x1 x2

gist:
	
	input args use "",especially use express like x* *a* ...
	it only work on csh.
